# archives-app

This repository contains the code for the [archives-app.vercel.app](https://archives-app.vercel.app) demo website.

This app is a NextJS/React/Supabase project to display transcribed archives. The supabase database and storage are hosted on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) using a free-tier plan which is sufficient for this project but feels a bit slows compared to a selfhosted/paid plan solution. 


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
